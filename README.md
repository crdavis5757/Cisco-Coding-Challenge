# Cisco-Coding-Challenge

This is my work product against the coding challenge you have given me.

It is a maven project which produces a jar file, challenge-0.0.1.jar.

The graph/node portion of the challenge (parts 1 and 2) can be executed as JUnit tests.
The word counting portion (part 3) can be executed via

  java -jar challenge-0.0.1.jar <path.to.text.file>
